The parts should be printed with at least 4 perimeters, 6 top and bottom layers, 40% infill and 0.2mm layer height. Cubic or gyro infill are usually pretty good. If you are using clear filament, Grid and honeycomb infill looks the nicest. You can also do concentric fill for your top and bottom layers which will look very nice.
