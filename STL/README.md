- The parts should be printed with at least 4 perimeters, 6 top and bottom layers, 40% infill and 0.2mm layer height. Cubic or gyro infill are usually pretty good. If you are using clear filament, Grid and honeycomb infill looks the nicest. You can also do concentric fill for your top and bottom layers which will look very nice.

- Please also adjust the expansion rate in the slicer, you can do so by scaling the model only in XY direction by percentage, ABS has about ~0.6% shrinkage, PETG has about ~0.15%, I am not too sure about PLA (it has a lesser tendency to shrink than PETG so probably negligible) but you can do a test by printing a long bar across the plate and measure the dimension to calculate the shrinkage.

- The Part "Melt_Zone" is recommended to print with a more heat resistant material such as PETG or ABS. PLA has not been tested yet, but we do believe it will survive because we did math and math is cool.

- In regards to the temperature for heatset inserts, PLA is around 225 °C, PETG is 245 °C, and ABS is 265 °C.

- All the functional parts can be printed on a 200mm x 200m build plate. The panels can be printed on a 250mm x 200mm plate.

Please also feel free to download and use the checklist tool to keep in track the parts printed.
